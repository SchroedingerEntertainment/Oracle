## Oracle - A simplified Pen & Paper based Roleplay System

Oracle is a simplified Pen & Paper based Roleplay System designed for shorter, arc-driven campaigns
and one-shot adventures in any kind of time and setting. Also the game can be played in any genre,
regardless if the story is told and the world illuminates in the traditional way or as the ground for building
digital gameplay on top. The game functions primarily as a conversation in which ideas, information,
actions, and dialogue are exchanged between you and your group until a situation arises where the
outcome is unclear. When dice are rolled to determine that outcome, the result helps ascertain whether
the player will achieve what they want and if it comes at a cost.

The rules and mechanics provided are meant to work for you, the narrator and the group. Anything may
be adapted, modified, or omitted based on the needs of the table and their desires. Within this you may
always choose to customize the world to see fit for your creations and have this serving as a foundation
for your adventures.

In Oracle you will build your character from a combination of up to two characteristics and classifications
each, that will provide bonuses and a unique set of skills driving your playstile. Experience epic adventures
while growing your character in any role and specialisation you like with unlimited options to choose from.
There is no correct way, nor any risks, as you may choose your skills without the limitations of levels or skill-
points. Grab your gear and gather your pack to conquer the world. An entire universe awaits you!
